\title{Age-to-Ring Mapping Function Calculate_K(a)
Deterministically maps true age to the expected annuli count, given
a survey date, an annual ring-formation day, and a minimum age threshold.}
\usage{
calculate_K(age_in_years, survey_date, annuli_date, annuli_min_age)
}
\arguments{
\item{age_in_years}{A numeric vector of true ages in years.}

\item{survey_date}{The survey date as a numeric year (e.g., 2023.25).}

\item{annuli_date}{Ring formation day as fraction of a year in [0, 1).}

\item{annuli_min_age}{The minimum age (years) required to form the first ring.}
}
\value{
An integer vector with the calculated number of rings (K) for each age.
